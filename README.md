## About


  Hello dears! My name is Maxim I am Front-end developer. 
Since the first time I saw on the screen "Hello world!"I realized that this is what I want to devote myself to! 
Since then has flowed away a lot of lines of code.

  –êt this stage of my life my main task and goal is to reach the top in Web - development. 
To do this, I always learn new technologies and thereby improve my skills and knowledge. And of course, a little about personal qualities:
commitment;
perseverance;
liability;
sociability;
the ability to work in a team;
attention to detail.
