## About

  Hello dears! My name is Maxim I am Front-end and IOS developer. Since the first time I saw on the screen "Hello world!"I realized that this is what I want to devote myself to! Since then has flowed away a lot of lines of code.

* development of business logic and back-end system for product support;
* user interface design;
* the creation of a functional API (joint work with front-end developers);
* cross-browser and adaptive HTML5/CSS3 layout.
  
My main responsibilities in ios development:
* development of mobile applications for iOS;
* mobile application support;
* participation in debugging and testing applications;
* placing apps in the AppStore;
* development of instructions for working with the finished product.
    

Аt this stage of my life my main task and goal is to reach the top in IOS development.To do this, I always learn new technologies and thereby improve my skills and knowledge. And of course, a little about personal qualities:
* commitment;
* perseverance;
* liability;
* sociability;
* the ability to work in a team;
* attention to detail.
